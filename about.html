I have a BSc in Information Technology and a Masters in Computer Application I started coding sometime around 2011, which is when I started studying Computer Science in the Punjab Technical University. After getting my BSc, I studied MCA. I've worked with various technologies in the past, but recently I've taken an interest in web development and web applications and programming. Ever since then, I've considered myself devoted to computer science. ❤";
